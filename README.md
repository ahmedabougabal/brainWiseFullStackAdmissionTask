To set up the backend and PostgreSQL database for this project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **__(note : ensure you are in the directory 'backend' before executing the following commands)__**.
3. Apply migrations:
   `python manage.py makemigrations departments accounts employees companies`  
   `python manage.py migrate`  
4. Load initial data:  
   `python manage.py loaddata fixtures/01_users.json`  
   `python manage.py loaddata fixtures/02_companies.json`  
   `python manage.py loaddata fixtures/03_departments.json`  
   `python manage.py loaddata fixtures/04_employees.json`
5. On Bash/Zsh CLI login to psql db as a root : *__sudo -u postgres psql__*
6. Create a PostgreSQL user with permissions:  
   `CREATE USER usernameOfYourChoice WITH PASSWORD '*******' CREATEDB;`  
7. Create a database with the user as the owner:  
   `CREATE DATABASE myBrainWiseTesting_db WITH OWNER = brainWiseAlpha;`  
8. Connect to the database: `\c myBrainWiseTesting_db`
